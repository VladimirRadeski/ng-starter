# Angular Starter

For bootstrapping new project with useful boilerplate containing:

- different application layouts
- authentication
- routing with lazy-loading
- integration with different stylesheet libraries

It might be that I missed something but you can grab and see for yourself.

Other features I'm interested in, and will be adding:

- Integrate with [ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) (store, effects and maybe router-store)
- Use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) for quick prototyping
- Tests
- And finally build something useful out of it

If you have any suggestions, please create issue.
